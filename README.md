# Fiber Gateway

![Golang](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Golang-blue.svg)

The Fiber Gateway is a GoLang-based project designed to serve as a versatile gateway for various API management

## Features

- **Load Balancing:** Distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple backend services to ensure optimal resource utilization and fault tolerance.

- **Rate Limiting:** Protect services from excessive traffic by setting rate limits on incoming requests.

- **API Forwarding:** Easily configure and manage the routing of API requests from clients to the appropriate backend services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the Fiber Gateway, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/): Make sure you have Go installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:khiem20tc/go-fiber-gorm-boilerplate.git
```

2. Create a `.env` file and define the necessary environment variables. These variables will be used for configuration. Example:

```
DATABASE_URL="localhost:5432"
```

3. Download and install packages

```bash
go mod download && go mod tidy
```

4. Run the Fiber Gateway using the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

or

```bash
nodemon --watch './**/*.go' --signal SIGTERM --exec 'go' run ./main.go
```

5. Run Lint-stage for Golang

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

5. Gen swagger API document using the following command:

```bash
go run ./scripts/gen-swagger/main.go && go run ./scripts/swag/main.go init --ot go,json --parseDependency true
```

6. Build docker container

```bash
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

## Usage

Once the Fiber Gateway is up and running, you can start sending API requests to it, and it will handle load balancing, rate limiting, and forwarding based on the configuration.
